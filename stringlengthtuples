#Write a function called string_length. string_length should
#have one parameter, a string. It should return a 2-tuple:
#the first item in the 2-tuple should be the string itself,
#and the second item should be the length of the string as
#given by the len() function.


#Write your function here!
def string_length(string):
    length = len(string)
    MyTuple = (string,length)
    return MyTuple


#Below are some lines of code that will test your function.
#You can change the value of the variable(s) to test your
#function with different inputs.
#
#If your function works correctly, this will originally
#print: 
print(string_length("Hello, world!"))
print(string_length("CS1301"))
print(string_length("Some people pronounce it 'toople'. Others pronounce it 'tuhple'. Either is correct."))

#answer key
def string_length(text):
    
    #All we need to do here is return a tuple where the first
    #item is text, and the second is len(text). We could
    #store len(text) in a separate variable, or we can create
    #it right in the tuple definition:
    
    return (text, len(text))


print(string_length("Hello, world!"))
print(string_length("CS1301"))
print(string_length("Some people pronounce it 'toople'. Others pronounce it 'tuhple'. Either is correct."))
